    <p style="text-align:center" title="About S.E.A Aquarium"> 
        It has been called many names: Sentosa Aquarium, Southeast Asia Aquarium and Singapore Aquarium. However, the actual way to say it is <b>"Sea Aquarium"</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The S.E.A Aquarium first opened in November 2012 and currently holds the title of the world's 3rd largest and most stunning aquarium, which contains over 12 million gallons of water. It has the world's largest viewing panel, spanning 36-metre (118 ft) wide and 8.3-metre (27 ft) tall, which aims to give visitors the experience of being on the ocean floor.
        <br>
        <br>
         It has over <a href="https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/sea-aquarium/things-to-do/animals"; target="_blank"> 100,000 marine animals</a> of over 1,000 species, living across 49 different habitats. It has 10 different zones in the aquarium which replicates different ocean habitats that various marine animals used to live in.  
        <br>
        <br>
         At the S.E.A. Aquarium, you will get to see the man-eating sharks, coral reefs, and other exotic marine animals such as the Giant Crab, Hammerhead Shark, Reef Manta Ray and Giant Moray Eel. It is a rare sight and a marine experience not to be missed! </p>

  <p style="text-align:center"; >As shown in the above map and video, it is actually quite easy to navigate around as it is a one-way loop! This means that you would get the chance to explore everything on display! However, it won't hurt to plan ahead and know what to look out for so that you can better appreciate the trip! 

Hence, I will share with you the visiting order of the different attractions and my inputs on each!

<br><br>
   <b><u>1. Shipwreck Habitat </u></b><br>
   This is the first exhibit you will encounter. It displays how shipwrecks can develop over time into flourishing marine habitats full of sponges and corals. You can view this view via the flat viewing panel or walkthrough tunnel.
   <br><br>

 <li>Vanda the miracle baby (Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4B3ZvehKUA"; target="_blank">video</a> to find out more).</li></ul>
     
   <p style="text-align:center";><b>
    
   <u>2. Shark Seas Habitat  </u></b><br>
   As you move along, you can enjoy the view of alpha predators of the ocean without being eaten. This exhibit consists of more than 70 sharks from 12 different species. Sharks are commonly misunderstood due to the negative portrayal in news and even films(e.g Jaws). You will learn more about their importance in maintaining the ocean ecosystem.

As you move along, you will get to enjoy the view of the alpha predators of the ocean. Fear not, you will not get eaten!

     <p style="text-align:center"; > 
      
   <b><u>3. Coral Garden </u></b><br>
     Despite its name, there are no corals in it. This is a cylindrical habitat that is 8m tall and 6m in diameter. It displays a vibrant multicoloured reef world housing 5000 fishes from more than 100 species. The corals look real but they are actually artificial! This is because reef-eating fishes will destroy the corals if placed inside the habitat? Then are there live corals in the visit? Read on to find out more!
     <br><br>

      <img src="Coral1.jpg" alt="Coral Garden" class="center" width="700" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Coral Garden">
      <br>

      There are also other reef habitats nearby which display moving colours of the ocean.  To me, it felt like a rainbow coming to life that seemed really natural which is pleasing for the eyes.

     <li>The Napoleon Wrasse. It is important to the coral reef ecosystem as its consumes crown-of-thorn starfishes which damages the coral reefs. </li>
     <li> If you have watched the movie “Finding Nemo”, you can try to look out for Dory, Nemo and his best friends.</li>
     <li> Personally, I enjoyed staring at the sea anemones and different coloured fishes in the tank. I was totally absorbed by its beauty, you can try it too!</li></ul>
      
    <p style="text-align:center">   
   <b><u>4. Open Ocean Gallery  </u></b><br>
     This habitat is the S.E.A. Aquarium's masterpiece. It is the size of 7 Olympic Swimming Pools (18 million litres of water) and is home to 120 species of animals. Interestingly, it is certified as a full open water dive site due to its size, volume and water motions. Dive lessons are currently suspended due to COVID. However, once it reopens, you may consider getting certified here! <br><br>

     <li> Mako is the largest manta ray with an almost fully black body and charismatic presence.</li>
     <li> Manja is the smallest and has a heart-shaped mark on his underside. He likes swimming around the aquarists during feeding time.</li></ul>

      <i>Looking at the white spotted sea jelly and thinking how similar it is to egg whites.</i>
   <br><br>
    
    It is one of the most beautiful places in the aquarium. The exhibits are enhanced by special lighting which accentuate the hydrodynamics in the sea jellies. It is a fascinating gelatinous-like animal made up of 95 percent water and has no brains, bones, blood, fins or teeth. So far there are only 6 species that are successfully bred in the aquarium. I personally think that the moon sea jelly and white spotted sea jelly are the nicest among all.

      <i>(Source: RWS Sentosa)</i>
     <br><br>
             Here comes the million dollar question you have all been waiting for! - Are there live corals? The answer is YES! In fact, S.E.A. Aquarium has one of the largest live coral displays globally but just that it is not in the Coral Garden(despite its name)!There is a segment which shows the culturing of corals using a process called fragging.

 <p style="text-align:center";>
   <b><u>1. Advice on what to Expect and Prepare </u></b><br>

<ul>
     <li>I would recommend taking 2-3 hours to explore all sections of S.E.A Aquarium sufficiently.</li>
<li>There are interactive learning panels on the side which explains more details of the species you are viewing. Do check them out to enhance your learning and enjoyment.</li>
<li>Wear light clothing and a comfortable pair of shoes as you will be walking and standing most of the time.</li>
<li>There are designated sitting areas so feel free to use them if visiting with seniors or children.</li>
<li>Try not to bring anything too heavy to the S.E.A Aquarium. If you really need a locker, the nearest place is at The Forum B1.</li>
<li>If you are visiting with infants, I highly recommend small strollers as there is a lot of walking and strollers are not available for rent inside the aquarium.</li>
<li>Take note that all shows, public feeding sessions and character meet-and-greet are currently unavailable till further notice. To know more, click <a href="https://www.rwsentosa.com/en/attractions/sea-aquarium/daily-shows"; target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

   <b><u> 2. Photography Tips </u></b><br>   
Want to take nice pictures but do not know how? Well I can guide you along with some short photography tips to up your photo game! 

<br><br>
<u>a. Use different colour display (For Sea Jellies Gallery) </u>
<br>
<img src="phototip1.jpeg" alt=" Sea Jellies Habitats" class="center" width="1000" height="450" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Different Coloured Background">
<br>
Different coloured background of the Sea Jellies Gallery  creates a different vibe for each photo. If you are not photo savvy like me, take yourself with all the colours and pick the nicest one out of all! 
<br><br>
<u>b. Take photos of yourself looking gently at the animal eyes </u>

<img src="phototip2.png" alt=" Stare with Love" class="center" width="800" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Staring with Love">

<br>

Look at the animal like how you will look at your wife, and have a relaxed pose! <br>
<i>*Do not take photos with a flash (Light will reflect off the glass and it creates stress towards the animals)</i>

<br><br>

<u>c. Try a back or side shot with silhouette </u>
<img src="Jelly1.jpg" alt="Sea Jellies Gallery" class="center" width="700" height="500" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Backshot at Sea Jellies Gallery">

<br>

It works most of the time especially in dark areas whereby there is no point taking a frontal shot since it is pretty dark. 

<br><br>

<u>d. Smile with your mask on! </u>
<img src="phototip4.jpg" alt="Posing with Diver" class="center" width="600" height="800" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Smile and Pose">

<br>

Despite the mask which covers your mouth, you can smile through your eyes! Also, it is a rare chance but if you spot a diver, you can take a photo with them. They are very friendly and spontaneous and would even take a photo with you!

<br><br>

<b><u> 3. Shopping and Dining </u></b><br> 

<img src="seafoodjoke.jpg" alt=" Fisherman Notebook" class="center" width="600" height="800" style="border:1px solid black;" title="Seafood Joke"> 
 <br>
After a long walk and seeing so many exotic animals, you might be hungry and start thinking about Unagi Don, Sashimi, Sambal Stingray and other seafood delicacies. There are some places that you can visit! </p>
